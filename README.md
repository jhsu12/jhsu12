## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I am an AI Engineer and a Master of Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a strong passion for building innovative, user-centric AI solutions. I have a background in developing and fine-tuning large language models, architecting complex RAG systems, and building full-stack applications from the ground up.  

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently exploring agentic AI systems and advanced NLP techniques.  
üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about Preference Learning, Theory of Mind, and the latest in Transformer architectures.  
üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open-source AI projects, especially those involving multi-modal systems or creative AI applications.  
üí¨ Ask me about LLM Fine-Tuning (QLoRA), RAG Systems, FastAPI, and deploying AI on GCP.  
üì´ How to reach me: **jasonhsutsean@gmail.com**  
üòÑ Pronouns: **He/Him**  
‚ö° Fun fact: I built and deployed a full-stack basketball analytics platform for a national team in under two weeks!
